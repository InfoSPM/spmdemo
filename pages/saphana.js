    question: "Q1:What is SAP HANA?",
    answer:
      <p className="w-100" style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>Answer: SAP HANA (High-Speed Analytical Appliance) is an in-memory database platform developed that can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud. It utilises in-memory computing to store summarised data in random access memory rather than storing it in relational databases on disk drives. In comparison to locating data on standard disks, SAP HANA can access in-memory data 10,000 times faster. Therefore, it empowers companies to quickly analyze large amounts of data and process transactions in seconds rather than hours.

One can get managed service plans for SAP HANA by going up the scale of service depth.

In case of factoring in the need for SAP support, security, compliance, cloud integration, DR and other services, it is not difficult to comprehend why customers end up with varied vendors to run SAP in the cloud. However, this is far from optimal. This type of set-up increments overhead and complexity, threatening SAP system reliability and opening up to various security risks.
