    question: "Q1:What is SAP HANA?",
    answer:
      <p className="w-100" style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>Answer: SAP HANA (High-Speed Analytical Appliance) is an in-memory database platform developed that can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud. It utilises in-memory computing to store summarised data in random access memory rather than storing it in relational databases on disk drives. In comparison to locating data on standard disks, SAP HANA can access in-memory data 10,000 times faster. Therefore, it empowers companies to quickly analyze large amounts of data and process transactions in seconds rather than hours.
